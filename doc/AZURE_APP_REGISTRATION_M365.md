## 🌐 Overview

The Mail Archiver application supports Microsoft 365 (M365) accounts using OAuth2 client credentials flow for email retrieval. Additionally, it provides retention policy functionality to automatically delete emails from the mail server after a specified period, helping manage storage space while maintaining a complete archive.

## ☁️ Azure App Registration for Email Retrieval

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Administrative access to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- A Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online licenses

### 🚀 Create App Registration

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in with your administrator account
3. In the left navigation pane, select **App registrations**
4. Click **+ New registration** at the top of the App registrations page
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Mail Archiver M365 Provider")
   - **Supported account types**: Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (Single tenant)
     - This is required for the client credentials flow used by Mail Archiver
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave this blank (not needed for client credentials flow)
6. Click **Register**

**Important**: Note down the following values from the **Overview** page:
- **Application (client) ID** - You'll need this as `ClientId` in Mail Archiver
- **Directory (tenant) ID** - You'll need this as `TenantId` in Mail Archiver

### 🔐 Set Required API Permissions

1. Navigate to **API permissions** in the left menu
2. Click **+ Add a permission**
3. Select **Microsoft Graph**
4. Choose **Application permissions** (required for Mail Archiver's client credentials flow)
5. Add the following permissions:
   - **Mail.Read** - Read mail in all mailboxes
   - **Mail.ReadWrite** - Read and write mail in all mailboxes (for restore function as well as deletion)
   - **User.Read.All** - Read all users' full profiles (required for Microsoft 365 tenant mailbox import; also provides `assignedPlans` for Exchange license filtering)

6. Click **Add permissions**
7. **CRITICAL**: Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**
8. Confirm by clicking **Yes**

**Note**: Application permissions are required because Mail Archiver uses client credentials flow to access mailboxes without user interaction.

### 🔑 Generate Client Secret

1. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets** in the left menu
2. Under **Client secrets**, click **+ New client secret**
3. Provide a description (e.g., "Mail Archiver Secret")
4. Select an expiration period
5. Click **Add**
6. **Important**: Copy the **Value** immediately and store it securely. This secret will not be shown again.

## 📧 Configure Mail Archiver M365 Account

After completing the app registration, you need to configure a M365 mail account in Mail Archiver with the following values:

### 📋 Required Values from App Registration:

1. **Client ID**: Copy the **Application (client) ID** from the app registration **Overview** page
2. **Client Secret**: Copy the **Value** you saved when creating the client secret
3. **Tenant ID**: Copy the **Directory (tenant) ID** from the app registration **Overview** page

### 🚀 Creating M365 Account in Mail Archiver:

1. Log into your Mail Archiver application
2. Navigate to **Mail Accounts** > **Create**
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the account (e.g., "Sales Team M365")
   - **Email Address**: The target mailbox email address to archive
   - **Provider**: Select **M365**
   - **Client ID**: Enter the Application (client) ID from your app registration
   - **Client Secret**: Enter the client secret value you saved
   - **Tenant ID**: Enter the Directory (tenant) ID from your app registration

4. Click **Create**

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

- The **Email Address** field must contain the actual mailbox you want to archive when creating a single M365 account.
- The app registration must have permissions to access the specified mailbox.
- To create accounts for all or selected mailboxes in the tenant at once, use the [Microsoft 365 Tenant Mailbox Import](M365TenantImport.md) guide.


## 🗑️ Retention Policy Setup

The Mail Archiver application provides retention policy functionality to automatically delete emails from the IMAP server after they have been successfully archived, helping manage storage space on the IMAP server while maintaining a complete archive.

### 🛠️ Configure Retention Policy

1. Navigate to **Mail Accounts** in the Mail Archiver application
2. Either create a new M365 account or edit an existing one
3. In the account configuration form, locate the **Delete After Days** field
4. Enter the number of days after which archived emails should be deleted from the server:
   - For example, enter `30` to delete emails after 30 days
   - Leave empty to disable automatic deletion
5. Save the account configuration


## ℹ️ Information Regarding Migrated Mailboxes

### 📁 Folders Not Visible After Migration

If you have migrated your mailbox from another email provider to Microsoft 365, some folders may not appear in the folder list.

#### 🔍 Background

Mail Archiver retrieves folder information from M365 mailboxes via the Microsoft Graph API. The application correctly requests all available folders (including hidden folders) and traverses the complete folder hierarchy.

However, the Microsoft Graph API returns only folders with `PR_CONTAINER_CLASS` set to `IPF.Note`. During mailbox migrations from other email systems, folders may be assigned a different container class such as `IPF.Imap`. These folders are not exposed through the Graph API's folder listing endpoints.

This behavior affects all applications using this API for folder retrieval.

#### 🔧 Workaround Options

**Option 1: Use MFCMAPI Tool (Recommended)**

1. Download [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/Microsoft/mfcmapi/) from Microsoft's official repository
2. Launch MFCMAPI and connect to your mailbox
3. Navigate to each missing folder
4. Change the `PR_CONTAINER_CLASS` property from `IPF.Imap` to `IPF.Note`
5. Restart Outlook and reload the folders in Mail Archiver

**Option 2: Recreate Folders in Outlook**

1. Create new folders directly in Outlook (these will have the correct `IPF.Note` class)
2. Move all emails from the migrated folders to the new folders
3. Delete the old migrated folders if desired

**Option 3: PowerShell Script (For Bulk Changes)**

For mailboxes with many migrated folders, you can use PowerShell with Exchange Online module to change the container class for multiple folders at once. Contact your Exchange administrator for assistance with this approach.
